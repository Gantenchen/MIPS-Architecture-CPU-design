    Number used as logic:                        8 out of  92,152    1%
      Number using O6 output only:               6
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                    2
      Number used as ROM:                        0
    Number used as Memory:                       0 out of  21,680    0%

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of occupied Slices:                     4 out of  23,038    1%
  Number of MUXCYs used:                         0 out of  46,076    0%
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:            8
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:             4 out of       8   50%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of       8    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:           4 out of       8   50%
    Number of unique control sets:               3
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:              20 out of 184,304    1%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
